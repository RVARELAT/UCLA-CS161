1. No, this SAT instance is not satisfiable.

2. Yes, this SAT instance is satisfiable.

3. The first SAT instance (with 3 colors) was unsatisfiable, which means it is not possible to color the graph using only 3 colors without breaking the rules which are no two connected (adjacent) nodes share the same color and every node has exactly one color.

The second SAT instance (with 4 colors) was satisfiable, which means it is possible to color the graph using 4 colors. So the graph needs at least 4 colors to be colored properly.

A valid 4-coloring of the graph is:
Node 1: color 1
Node 2: color 2
Node 3: color 1
Node 4: color 2
Node 5: color 4
Node 6: color 3
Node 7: color 4

4. 8 colors
